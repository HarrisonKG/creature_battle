This project implements a polymorphic class hierarchy in C++ as the basis for a CLI fantasy combat game.   
It has an abstract base class, which is inherited by the individual character classes.


The makefile can be run with three commands:
# 1. "make" makes the program Project3   2. "make clean" cleans the directory   
# 3. "make memcheck" runs valgrind to test for memory leaks
